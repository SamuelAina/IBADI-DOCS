1. Download the SQL script from https://github.com/SamuelAina/IBADI/blob/master/IBADI-SETUP.SQL
2. Go to your database server and open the file in SSMS.
3. Optionally you may change the name of the database in the script from ibadidb to whatever you want.
4. Run the SQL script within your SSMS while in the master database.
